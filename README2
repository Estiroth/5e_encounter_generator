#This isn't code, I'm just trying to contact you @jforstneric
#I recently compiled all my 5e homebrew monsters into a database with the intent of then creating an encounter generator that can use all
#the monsters in my repertoire.
#I have no python experience however;
#When looking for some tutorials I stumbled accross this github and tested it; then I tried to alter the code so it would fit my purposes
#I do have some - probably - basic questions though that I hope you could help me with. If you would be so kind, contact me in discord Ubbe#5702
#Thanks for your time
